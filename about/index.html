    <h1>About Mike</h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>Hi! I am Mike Salmela, a software developer currently living in Nokia, working at Tampere (although mostly remotely from my home).
In this blog I&rsquo;ll be writing about pretty much anything software development related that I&rsquo;ve been learning or using.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing some blog posts about my hobby projects online with a not-so-steady pace of one or two posts a year. I&rsquo;m not really promoting my blog anywhere (at least at the moment of writing), so I&rsquo;m not quite sure how you ended up here, but welcome anyways!</p>
<p>I started my programming career with Jolla in 2019, developing the Sailfish OS, a Linux based mobile operating system. After a few years there I&rsquo;ve been working as a software consultant, mostly working on Linux and IoT devices.
Based on that background, you&rsquo;ll be most likely to see posts here related to Linux, Yocto and programming languages in general.</p>
<h2 id="why-am-i-writing-a-blog">Why am I writing a blog?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this blog mostly just for myself with the goal of learning more.</p>
<p>When I write about the new things that I&rsquo;ve just learned, I truly need to understand what I&rsquo;m doing.
It&rsquo;s too easy to copy a solution online and paste it to your project
but if you need to write about it and explain what&rsquo;s happening in your program, you&rsquo;re forced to understand it too.
So, by writing about the software I&rsquo;ve developed, I am forcing myself to learn even more than just by writing the programs.</p>
<p>Another thing I&rsquo;m hoping to improve with this is my writing skills in general. That has never been one of my strong points.
I usually learn best by doing (who doesn&rsquo;t?), so I guess if I write enough of these little blogs of mine, I&rsquo;ll eventually get better in writing too!</p>
<p>If you wish to message me, feel free to use my <a href="https://salmmike.github.io/salmmike-pub-pgp.txt">PGP key</a>.
My email is &lt;firstname&gt;.&lt;lastname&gt;@iki.fi</p>
