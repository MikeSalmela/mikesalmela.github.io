      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to start learning some Rust, and started by creating a chip8 emulator. In my previous blog post , I mentioned I was planning to emulate something like a NES in the future. And that&amp;rsquo;s what I have started doing now. My journey towards a working NES emulator starts by creating a 6502 processor emulator.
I spent a few weekends writing the 6502 emulator, and before long, I had a first version up and running.</description>

      <description>As a software developer, it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to learn some new things. For this reason, I decided to start learing the Rust programming language, which seems to be the new cool kid in town. For quite a long time, I disrecarded Rust as yet another &amp;ldquo;C killer&amp;rdquo;, a type of language that claims to be the next big thing, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t really ever get used in anything real. Now that Rust is even getting into the Linux kernel , I guess it&amp;rsquo;s something I should look into.</description>

      <title>Advantech USB-4761 relays, C&#43;&#43; and Python</title>

      <description>Recently I was trying to control the relays of an Advantech USB-4761 DAQ-module from a Linux box in a Python project. I decided to write a little post about it because I couldn’t find any good documentation or a StackOverflow answer that would suit my needs. Maybe someone will face a similar problem someday and end up here.
The DAQNavi library I downloaded the Linux DAQNavi driver install script from Advantech&amp;rsquo;s website and ran it.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever fiddled around with microcontroller development boards, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed that blinking an LED is pretty much the hello world of the microcontroller world. By no means am I an expert in bare-metal programming, but to me, it seems that the usual procedure for creating an MCU hello world is the following:</description>
